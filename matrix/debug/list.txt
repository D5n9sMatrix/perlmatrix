BUGS AND PROBLEMS

Because we change the way piddles are constructed, not all pdl operators may be applied to
piddle-matrices. The inner product is not redefined. We might have missed some functions/methods.
Internal consistency of our approach needs yet to be established.

Because PDL::Matrix changes the way slicing behaves, it breaks many operators,
notably those in MatrixOps.
