FUNCTIONS
mpdl, PDL::Matrix::pdl

constructs an object of class PDL::Matrix which is a piddle child class.

    $m = mpdl [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];
    $m = PDL::Matrix->pdl([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]);

mzeroes, mones, msequence

constructs a PDL::Matrix object similar to the piddle constructors zeroes, ones, sequence.
vpdl

constructs an object of class PDL::Matrix which is of matrix dimensions (n x 1)

    print $v = vpdl [0,1];
    [
     [0]
     [1]
    ]

vzeroes, vones, vsequence

constructs a PDL::Matrix object with matrix dimensions (n x 1), therefore only the first
scalar argument is used.

    print $v = vsequence(2);
    [
     [0]
     [1]
    ]

kroneckerproduct

returns kroneckerproduct of two matrices. This is not efficiently implemented.
det_general

returns a generalized determinant of a matrix. If the matrix is not regular, one can specify
the rank of the matrix and the corresponding subdeterminant is returned. This is implemented
using the eigens function.
trace

returns the trace of a matrix (sum of diagonals)
