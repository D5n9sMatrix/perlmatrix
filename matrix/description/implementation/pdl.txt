Furthermore one can construct and use vectors as n x 1 matrices without mentioning the
second index '1'.
Implementation

PDL::Matrix works by overloading a number of PDL constructors and methods such that first and
second args (corresponding to first and second dims of corresponding matrices) are effectively
swapped. It is not yet clear if PDL::Matrix achieves a consistent column-major look-and-feel
in this way.
